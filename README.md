# Sales Analysis using MySQL
Objective
Demonstrate core SQL skills by creating a database, populating it with two sample schemas (Sales and Student), and executing a range of queries—from basic selects and filters to aggregates, window functions, and CTEs.

Tech Stack
Database: MySQL

Client: MySQL Workbench / VS Code

Steps Included
Create YISU database and CHANDU schema

Import or define Sales table and run filter, sort, and aggregation queries

Create Student table; insert sample records

Apply window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE)

Build CTEs to filter by specific ranks

Rename tables and demonstrate schema modifications

Analysis Includes
Regional and country‑level sales summaries

Top products and shipping‑mode performance

Average sales by ship mode with HAVING filters

Student score rankings and cohort segmentation via NTILE

CTE‑based extraction of specific rank groups

Key Insights
Highest‑revenue region: (e.g., North with $X total)

Top 3 countries by sales: (e.g., US, UK, Germany)

Most efficient ship mode: (e.g., Economy avg. $Y)

Top student performers: (e.g., Priya, Sneha, Amit)

Conclusion
This project showcases end‑to‑end SQL proficiency: from schema setup and CRUD operations to advanced analytics using window functions and CTEs. It’s a solid foundation for any data‑driven application.
